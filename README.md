# nodejs-filesystem

This is a Back-end Project created with Node-JS, Express and other dependencies. 
Created 2 API end points:
  1. To create a .txt file in a specified folder, with the file name and content as current timestamp
  2. To retrieve all the text files in the specidied folder.

Replace the Folder name with the desired path in the code (index.js)

Tested using Thunder-Client and POSTMAN to create and retrieve Files. 

100% working...

Check the POSTMAN Documentation for the Create and Get API End-point:
